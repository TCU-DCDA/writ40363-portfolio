# Lab 04 – Links, Images, and Lists Enhancement

> Delivery Mode: In-Class Activity (Formative)

Goal: Enrich semantic variety and ensure all media is purposeful while practicing Git workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Lab 03 (Git Introduction & HTML Foundations)
- Active Git repository with existing HTML foundation
- Understanding of semantic HTML structure

## Git Workflow Setup
Work in your existing `personal-website-foundation` repository from previous labs.

## Tasks
1. **Add a new section: `Resources`** with an unordered list of 3 external links (each descriptive; no duplicate domains).
2. **Add one internal link** from top nav/intro to a lower section ID (add `id` to target heading).
3. **Replace any decorative image** with CSS background later (for now add an HTML comment `<!-- candidate for CSS background -->`).
4. **Add a second figure:** includes `<figure>`, `<img>`, `<figcaption>` (caption ≤12 words).

## Link Rules
- External links: `rel="noopener"`.
- No raw URLs as link text.

## Git Workflow for This Lab
**Commit after each major task:**
- `Add external resources section with links`
- `Implement internal navigation links`
- `Add figure elements with proper captions`
- `Improve accessibility and link semantics`

## Success Criteria
- At least 4 total external links now on the page.
- Internal jump works (click tests in browser).
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub.

## Submission Instructions
**Submit repository URL** to D2L - use your existing `personal-website-foundation` repository.

## Stretch
- Add an ordered list explaining a 3‑step process you follow (e.g., researching a topic).
