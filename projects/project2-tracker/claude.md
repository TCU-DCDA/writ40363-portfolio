# Claude Code Instructions

## Core Principles

1. **Make NO assumptions** - Always ask for clarification when requirements are unclear or ambiguous.

2. **No unauthorized changes** - Make no changes that have not been explicitly approved by the user.

3. **Number conversation entries** - Number all entries into the conversation for easy reference and tracking.
