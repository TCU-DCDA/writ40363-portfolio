# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

## Project Overview

This is my final project for WRIT 40363, where I'm building an ambitious web application using AI as a development partner. The goal is to demonstrate upskilling—taking techniques learned in Projects 1-3 and pushing beyond them with AI assistance.

**Key Focus:** Deep learning and insight through ambitious experimentation. A partially-working app with deep reflection is more valuable than a perfect app without understanding.

## What I'm Building

[Project description and purpose - to be completed]

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** - Advanced styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Interactive functionality and data management
- [Additional technologies and APIs - to be added]

## Upskilled Techniques

This project demonstrates at least 3 upskilled techniques from the course:

### From Project 1 (HTML/CSS Foundations)
- [Technique and how it was upskilled]

### From Project 2 (JavaScript Fundamentals)
- [Technique and how it was upskilled]

### From Project 3 (APIs & Advanced JS)
- [Technique and how it was upskilled]

### New Techniques (Learned via AI)
- [New technique learned through AI collaboration]

## AI Collaboration

This project was developed in partnership with AI assistants. For detailed documentation of my AI collaboration process, see:

- **[AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md](AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md)** - Tools used, learning moments, challenges, and sample conversations
- **[REFLECTION.md](REFLECTION.md)** - Developer reflection on the learning journey (500-750 words)

### AI Tools Used
- [List of AI assistants used: Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.]

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository
2. [Additional setup steps as needed]
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser or deploy to GitHub Pages

## Live Demo

[Deployed URL - to be added when deployed]

## Features
