        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a professor in the English department at Texas Christian University and a creative practitioner with over 30 years of experience exploring the intersections between traditional literary forms and emerging digital media.</p>
        <p>My work spans three art forms: poetry published in prestigious journals like The Sun Magazine and Florida Review, experimental digital literature projects, and musical collaborations including current work with The Deep Sleepers. I create interactive digital poetry projects that combine Python, JavaScript, and multimedia elements to explore new forms of literary expression.</p>
        <p>As an educator, I focus on helping students develop both technical skills and creative thinking through courses like HTML & CSS coding, digital storytelling, and multimedia poetry creation. Students consistently praise my supportive teaching approach, clear grading criteria, and ability to make technical subjects accessible and engaging.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm teaching WRIT40363 while learning how to teach web application development to my students, building accessible, semantic web pages using professional development practices. I'm particularly interested in how AI tools can enhance rather than replace human creativity and critical thinking in the digital humanities classroom.</p>
